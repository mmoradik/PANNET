# PANNET
PANNET is a non-fully connected recurrent neural network which is developed for time series prediction. 
Network structure and connection weights are trained by a customized evolutionary genetic algorithm.
The PANNET code is written in python. Prediction results of sunspot time series are shown as an example.
