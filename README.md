# PANNET
PANNET is a non-fully connected recurrent neural network which developed for time series prediction. 
Network structure and connection weights are trained by a customized evolutionary genetic algorithm.
The PANNET code is written in python and tested for sunspot time series as a benchmark.

Code needs to be further improved for readability. Data can be freely used to compare your algorithms with ours
